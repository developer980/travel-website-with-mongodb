## The model of a booking web application which uses Cheerio to scrape hotels data from two websites and return it based on the user's preferences

## Note! 

### - The private destinations (rented appartements) might not appear on the map as the google maps API doesn't have enough data about them. I'm stiil figuring a way to fix this.

### - The "Guests" field and the filter section are not functional yet.

### - Right now the scrapping functions only work on the local environment. I might switch to Puppeteer from Cheerio which will allow the app to scrape data dynamically loaded on the page.
